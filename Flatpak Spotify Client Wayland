Spotify flatpak has opt in wayland support
To opt in according to the docs supply this to flatpak run
--socket=wayland com.spotify.Client
However this still used Xwayland. So... the executable also needs the following argument 
--ozone-platform=wayland
Now we wayland. But...for some reason this misaligns the mouse with the window contents and causes window trails on resize. The fix?
change the command argument from
--command=spotify
to
--command=/app/extra/bin/spotify
I don't know
So, we wayland properly? not quite. The cursor is now tiny. To fix apply the following env variable to the flatpak
XCURSOR_PATH=/run/host/user-share/icons:/run/host/share/icons
Now we wayland. Shame about the awful client side decorations though. One day...
